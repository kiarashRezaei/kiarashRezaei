# üëã Hi, I'm Kiarash  

## üöÄ About Me  
I am a recent **Telecommunication Engineering** master's graduate from **Politecnico di Milano**, driven by a deep passion for leveraging **data-driven methods** across diverse domains, such as **communication systems**, **Edge-AI sensors**, and **biomedical applications**.  

I specialize in **Explainable AI (XAI)** and aim to develop transparent and interpretable AI models for stakeholders and end-users. My expertise includes **AI/ML**, **deep learning**, and **XAI**, complemented by hands-on experience in designing scalable, domain-specific solutions.  

Most recently, I worked as an **AI Researcher at STMicroelectronics**, where I applied **TinyML** and **Quantization-Aware Training** techniques to develop innovative MEMS calibration solutions. I also utilized **XAI techniques** to make complex models more understandable in various applications, including communication networks, medical diagnostics, and sensor systems.

### üéØ Interests  
- üå± Currently expanding my expertise in **ML/DL applications**, **XAI**, and multidisciplinary AI/ML solutions.  
- ü§ù Open to collaborations on **AI projects** focused on **communication systems**, **IoT sensors**, and **biomedical data**.  
- üí¨ Feel free to ask me about **Explainable AI**, **Deep Learning**, **Signal Processing**, or **Computer Vision**.  
- üì´ Reach out: [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/kiarash-rezaei-149b4b175) | [Email](mailto:kiarashrezaei@yahoo.com)  
- ‚ö° Fun fact: I‚Äôm passionate about bridging the gap between **black-box models** and **human understanding**.
