# Hi there üëã, I'm Kiarash Rezaei

## üöÄ About Me
I am a recent master graduate in **Telecommunication Engineering** from **Politecnico di Milano** with a deep passion for applying **data-driven methods** across diverse application domains, including **communication systems**, **Edge-AI sensors**, and **biomedical applications**. I am particularly interested in **Explainable AI (XAI)**, aiming to create AI models that are transparent and interpretable for end-users and stakeholders. My expertise spans **AI/ML**, **deep learning**, and **XAI**, with hands-on experience in developing scalable solutions tailored to specific domains.

I recently completed an AI Researcher role at **STMicroelectronics**, where I developed cutting-edge solutions for **MEMS calibration** using TinyML and Quantization-Aware Training. My work applies **XAI techniques** to ensure that even complex models are understandable, whether in communication networks, medical diagnostics, or real-time sensor applications.

- üå± I‚Äôm currently focused on deepening my knowledge in **ML/DL applications**, **XAI**, and multidisciplinary AI/ML solutions.
- üëØ I‚Äôm eager to collaborate on **AI projects** that push the boundaries in **communication systems**, **IoT sensors**, and **biomedical data**.
- üí¨ Ask me about **Explainable AI**, **Data-Driven Systems**, **Deep Learning**, **Signal Processing**, or **Computer Vision**.
