# üëã Hi, I'm Kiarash  

## üöÄ About Me  
I‚Äôm a PhD researcher at **Chalmers University of Technology**, working at the intersection of **trustworthy AI**, **explainable machine learning**, and **communication systems**. My research focuses on building robust, interpretable models for intelligent network management, with an emphasis on real-world reliability and generalization.

Before joining Chalmers, I worked as an **AI Researcher at STMicroelectronics**, where I developed quantization-aware and memory-efficient neural networks for edge AI applications. This experience deepened my interest in scalable and efficient ML for safety-critical systems.

I hold an MSc in **Telecommunication Engineering** from **Politecnico di Milano**, where I specialized in signal processing, statistical learning, and AI foundations.


### üéØ Research Interests  
- **Trustworthy & Explainable AI (XAI)**  
- **Domain Adaptation, Generalization and Representational Learning**  
- **Robust ML for Communication & Networked Systems**  
- **Edge AI**
- I‚Äôm always open to research collaborations, technical discussions, and academic exchange in these areas.

üì´ Connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/kiarash-rezaei-149b4b175) or reach out via [email](mailto:kiarashr@chalmers.se)
- ‚ö° Fun fact: I‚Äôm passionate about bridging the gap between **black-box models** and **human understanding**.
